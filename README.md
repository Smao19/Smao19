# 👋 Hi, I'm Sebastian Arteaga

I'm a computer science and math student at Northeastern University passionate about building intelligent, data-driven systems. I enjoy working on backend-heavy, performance-optimized applications and love designing modular systems that are easy to test, extend, and deploy.

## 💻 I'm Currently Working On

- **Three Trios** – Java-based strategy card game  
  → Configurable rulesets, GUI, and AI strategies  
  → Built from scratch with MVC and design patterns (Factory, Builder, Adapter, etc.)

- **MBTA Transit Analysis** – Boston public transit project  
  → Used K-means clustering, regression, and geospatial data to highlight underserved areas  
  → Developed robust data pipelines and predictive models for urban planning insights

- **Fynn** – Recently developed an AI-powered financial advisor chatbot  
  → Combines GPT-4 with real-time financial, housing, and banking APIs  
  → Built a secure backend using Flask, Firestore, and Google Cloud  
  *(Currently polishing the project before publishing it)*

- **Equity Pairs Trading Research & Backtesting System** – Quantitative finance research project  
  → Built a **portfolio-level, vectorized backtesting engine** in Python to simulate mean-reversion statistical arbitrage strategies  
  → Engineered **realistic execution modeling** on leg prices with dollar-neutral hedging, capital constraints, and configurable commission/slippage assumptions  
  → Designed a **statistically rigorous pair-selection pipeline**: correlation screening, Engle-Granger cointegration, ADF, Hurst, and half-life analyses, plus rolling beta-stability filtering  
  → Integrated **confidence- and volatility-based position sizing** with safeguards, portfolio-wide PnL tracking, and advanced performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, drawdowns, win rate, equity curves)  
  → Developed a **modular signal-model architecture** supporting interchangeable models, derived from research:  
    - *Model 1*: Static Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) with Monte Carlo–optimized thresholds  
    - *Model 2*: Dynamic OU estimation with stochastic volatility and thresholds from stopping theory  
    - *Model 3*: Dynamic OU augmented with ML-based volatility-regime classification for adaptive thresholding  
  *(Core system completed; currently working on devloping the signal generation models)*
