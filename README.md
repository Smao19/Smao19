# 👋 Hi, I'm Sebastian Arteaga

I'm a computer science and math student at Northeastern University passionate about building intelligent & data-driven systems, and exploring the applications of machine learning & quantitative techniques in finance. My experience lies at the intersection of engineering and research. I’m curious about markets, excited by complex problems, and always looking to expand my technical and analytical toolkit.

## 💻 I'm Currently Working On

- **Equity Pairs Trading Research & Backtesting System** – Quantitative finance research project  
  → Built a **portfolio-level, vectorized backtesting engine** in Python to simulate mean-reversion statistical arbitrage strategies  
  → Engineered **realistic execution modeling** on leg prices with dollar-neutral hedging, capital constraints, and configurable commission/slippage assumptions  
  → Designed a **statistically rigorous pair-selection pipeline**: correlation screening, Engle-Granger cointegration, ADF, Hurst, and half-life analyses, plus rolling beta-stability filtering  
  → Integrated **confidence- and volatility-based position sizing** with safeguards, portfolio-wide PnL tracking, and advanced performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, drawdowns, win rate, equity curves)  
  → Developed a **modular signal-model architecture** supporting interchangeable models, derived from research:  
    - *Model 1*: Static Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) with Monte Carlo–optimized thresholds  
    - *Model 2*: Dynamic OU estimation with stochastic volatility and thresholds from stopping theory  
    - *Model 3*: Dynamic OU augmented with ML-based volatility-regime classification for adaptive thresholding  
  *(Core system & pair research completed; currently working on devloping the signal generation models)*
