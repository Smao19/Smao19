# 👋 Hi, I'm Sebastian Arteaga

I'm a computer science and math student at Northeastern University passionate about building intelligent, data-driven systems. I enjoy working on backend-heavy, performance-optimized applications and love designing modular systems that are easy to test, extend, and deploy.

## 💻 What I'm Working On

- **Three Trios** – Java-based strategy card game  
  → Configurable rulesets, GUI, and AI strategies  
  → Built from scratch with MVC and design patterns (Factory, Builder, Adapter, etc.)

- **MBTA Transit Analysis** – Boston public transit project  
  → Used K-means clustering, regression, and geospatial data to highlight underserved areas  
  → Developed robust data pipelines and predictive models for urban planning insights

- **Fynn** – Recently developed an AI-powered financial advisor chatbot  
  → Combines GPT-4 with real-time financial, housing, and banking APIs  
  → Built a secure backend using Flask, Firestore, and Google Cloud  
  *(Currently polishing the project before publishing it)*
